# Aim

The aim of this experiment is to introduce the concepts of finite fields. The experiment would begin with prime fields $\mathbb{F}_{p}$, where $p \geq 2$ is a prime number. We will then introduce the extended Euclidean Algorithm and the construction of finite fields. Further, the student will learn the representation of field elements and minimal polynomials.
The structure of the experiment is as follows:

- Euclidean Division Algorithm:
- Elements of Finite Field
- Minimal Polynomial
