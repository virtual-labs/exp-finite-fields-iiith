# Aim 

In this experiment, we shall focus on finite fields. We will describe prime fields, construction of fields of
size which is a power of prime, primitive element of a field, minimal polynomials and
sub-fields of a finite field.

The structure of the experiment is as follows:

- Euclidean Division Algorithm:
- Elements of Finite Field
- Minimal Polynomial
