### Procedure

There are three tasks in this experiment.
<br>
<br>

**Procedure for Euclidean Division Algorithm:**
*   Using landscape mode is recommended on mobile phones and other smaller screens.
*   Polynomials can be entered in the fields provided. Use only lower case x in the field.
*   Expressions like x<sup>2</sup> can be entered in the field by typing x^2 on the keyboard.
*   1, x, +, x^2, x^3 and their combinations need to be entered in the fields in this task. Do not enter any other symbols.
*   Enter the values in all the fields of a row and click on <b>Submit</b>.
*   The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
*   If the answer is correct, proceed to the next row. Values in the fields of a row cannot be entered without completing the previous row correctly.
*   Repeat this process until all the rows are filled and the algorithm is complete when a success message displaying the GCD appears in <b>Observations</b>.
*   <b>Next</b> - Displays the next example.
*   <b>Previous</b> - Displays the previous example.

**Procedure for Elements of Finite Field:**
*   Typing alpha on the keyboard displays the symbol &alpha;.
*  Expressions like &alpha;<sup>2</sup> can be entered in the field by typing alpha^2 on the keyboard.
*   Enter the values in the fields and click on <b>Submit</b>.
*  0, 1, alpha, +, alpha^2, alpha^3 and their combinations need to be entered in the fields in this task. Do not enter any other symbols.
*   The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
*   <b>Next</b> - Displays the next example.
*   <b>Previous</b> - Displays the previous example.

**Procedure for Minimal Polynomial:**
*  Using landscape mode is recommended on mobile phones and other smaller screens.
*  First select element(s) of the finite field from the left column by clicking on it. The background color changes to red indicating that the element has been selected.
*  Then select the corresponding minimal polynomial from the right column by clicking on it.
*  If the correct polynomial is selected, the element(s) and minimal polynomial turn green indicating that it is a correct match. The correct answer message is displayed in <b>Observations.</b>
*  If the answer is wrong, the wrong answer message is displayed in <b>Observations</b>. Try again by selecting another minimal polynomial.
*  Repeat this procedure until all the elements are matched with the corresponding minimal polynomials.
*   <b>Next</b> - Displays the next example.
*   <b>Previous</b> - Displays the previous example.
